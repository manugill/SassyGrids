# SassyGrids

Just import SassyGrids and you're good to go!

* @import 'sassygrids';

Sassygrids is a SASS processed grid system that will automate the majority of your project with a few simple variables:

* $columnWidth:       40;
* $numberOfColumns:   16;
* $gutterWidth:       20;
* $breakDimensions:   auto 4;

## Using the application

When you arrive at (http://sassygrids.com/) you will be
see a settings dropdown menu that will adjust the site
layout, so you can change and see the effects working.

### Adjusting the grid

When you drag the browser's toolbar left and right you'll see your grid shift and adjust and where things may break or
become too stretched or condensed, it's really fun!

As you update the number of columns, column padding and gutter width you
will see your grid changing in real time with the settings dropdown.


### Downloading your grids

When you are finished, you have 3 choices on how to download your sassy project, you can download your project with your current settings
and JavaScript will constructe and serve up your project in a convenient ZIP file, all setup up and ready to go!

## Using Sassy in your project

Sassy does depend on two functions which are imported in compass and bourbon by default, however I've stripped these out, if you don't want to
double up you may have to dig in to the sassygrids.scss file and remove the two functions.
